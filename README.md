# LearnScons
## Purpose
	This project is used to learn how to use scons, in boudica project, we use a smart framework of scons, I wanna to use it now.
	We compile all of the modules through a same way wchich is named ModuleUtils.py. It's great. But another question is that we should use the same module for every module, it's not good :-)
